# Commands Documentation

## Editing commands

### Destroy
The `destroy [<arg1>=<val1>,<arg2>=<val2>,...]` commands edits a video according to the parameters </br>
- `destroy bass=100` or `destroy bass 100`

To use multiple commands, use `,` to separate them
- `bass=100, hypercam`

To use multiple groups of commands, use `|` to separate groups of commands.
- `ytp=100,toptext=hi|hcycle=3`

### Download
The `download <video>` command takes one parameter `video` as a search query and downloads the first result regardless of URL (no idea why)
- `download chevron cars lore` or `download <URL/video ID>`
- Not always reliable, up to 8 MB (?)

### Concat
The `concat <n> [<video1>, <video2>, ...]` command can take in `<n>` videos and concatinate them. You can type just the start of the filename to order them.
- `concat 2 g h`
- Say the channel has two recent videos "hello.mp4" and "goodbye.mp4", this concatinates the videos with "goodbye.mp4" coming first

## Metacommands:

### Pecking order

When doing an editing command, the order is as followed:
- Attachments > attachments of replied to message > recent messages in channel
    
### Command chaining
You can link together commands using `>>` between them.
- `download posy asmr >> destroy speed 5, toptext hello` would download `posy asmr`, post it, then add a caption "hello"
- Often comes with cooldown though and sometimes unreliable
    
By adding `!` at the start of a command, the bot, when replying to itself, will override the previous message by deleting it before sending the result.
- `!download woman dancing >> !destroy e 30, speed 5, mute, music penis music, musicskip 8 >> download man dancing >> !destroy e 30, speed 5, mute, music dramatic music, musicskip 25, volume 2 >> concat >> cap face off`
- This will download two videos, speed up, mute, add a song and caption to them, and then finally concatinate them
